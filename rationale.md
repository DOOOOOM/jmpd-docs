Rationale
=========

The idea for jMPD as a project was chosen because it is a medium size project
that is likely to fall into the time frame and code size requirements for this
class.  Additionally, there are many features that are non-essential, that may
be included or ommited in order to meet said requirements.  For example,
authentication between the client and server is not a required feature, but
will be implemented if time permits. Furthermore, this is an application that
should prove useful outside of this class and has the possibility 

This project is loosely based on the Music Player Daemon (MPD) project
found at www.musicpd.org. Some design features, for example the way that
playlists are inserted into the play queue, were chosen in order to mirror
MPD as it is a proven environment familiar to many people.
